# Smart Investor Profiling and Reporting Workflow

This workflow is a comprehensive automation engine that bridges the gap between raw client data and expert-level financial advice. Upon receiving a new onboarding form from Google Sheets, the system fetches real-time market data via Alpha Vantage, uses Groq-powered AI to synthesize this data with the client’s risk profile and generates a structured investment strategy. It then updates your internal CRM, alerts your team via Slack and emails a personalized, professional investment report directly to the client—all in a matter of seconds.

### Quick Implementation Steps

- [**Import**: Upload the JSON file into your n8n canvas](https://n8n.partnerlinks.io/om1efg2qgvwi).
- **Connect**: Authenticate your Google Sheets, Alpha Vantage (HTTP Request), Groq, Slack and Gmail accounts.
- **Prepare CRM**: Create a Google Sheet with these headers: **Timestamp, Name, Age, Income, Profile Summary, Risk Category, Strategy, Email**.
- **Set Market Symbol**: Open the **Fetch Market Data** node and replace `RELIANCE.BSE` with your preferred stock or index symbol.
- **Deploy**: Click **Start Workflow** to test, then set to ‘Active’ for real-time processing.

## What It Does

The workflow functions as an intelligent middleman for financial advisory firms. It starts by capturing a lead’s personal details (age, income, risk appetite) from an onboarding spreadsheet. To ensure the advice is timely, it immediately queries a market API to get the latest price trends and volatility metrics. This “dual-context” (client data + market data) is then fed into a high-performance Groq AI model.

The AI generates a sophisticated output that includes a written investor profile, a risk classification and a specific portfolio allocation (Equity, Debt, Gold). To maintain data integrity, a structured parser ensures the AI’s response is converted into clean data fields that update your master CRM automatically.

Finally, the workflow handles the entire communication loop. It sends a highly formatted HTML email to the client containing their custom strategy, while simultaneously posting a detailed summary to your Slack channel. This ensures your team is instantly aware of new high-value leads and their specific needs.

## Who It’s For

- **Financial Advisors & Wealth Managers** who want to provide “instant-gratification” value to new leads.
- **Investment Firms** looking to standardize their risk profiling using AI and real-time data.
- **FinTech Startups** automating the transition from sign-up to personalized dashboard content.
- **Brokerage Operations** teams needing to sync client onboarding with internal CRM databases and team alerts.

## Requirements to use this workflow

- [**n8n accouny**: (Self-hosted or Cloud)](https://n8n.partnerlinks.io/om1efg2qgvwi).
- **Alpha Vantage API Key**: For fetching real-time market trends.
- **Groq API Key**: To power the “Analyze Investor Profile” AI node.
- **Google Account**: For Sheets (Onboarding/CRM) and Gmail (Client communication).
- **Slack Workspace**: For internal team notifications.

## How It Works & Setup Guide

### 1. Triggering & Rate Control

The workflow starts with a **Manual Trigger** or a **Google Sheets** fetch. The **Rate Limit Control** node is set to process one item at a time, ensuring you don’t hit API limits on your Market or AI accounts during a bulk upload.

### 2. Market Intelligence

The **Fetch Market Data** node uses an HTTP Request to pull live data. You must enter your Alpha Vantage API key in the `apikey` query parameter. The **Process Market Data** and **Generate Market Insights** nodes use JavaScript to determine if the current market is “Bullish” or “Bearish” and calculate volatility.

### 3. AI Analysis & Parsing

The **Analyze Investor Profile** node sends all client and market variables to Groq. The **Profile Data Parser** ensures the AI’s response follows a strict JSON schema, which is vital for the data to be saved correctly in your spreadsheet.

### 4. Storage & Communication

The **Update CRM** node appends the AI’s findings to your spreadsheet. Once the database is updated, the workflow branches to send a **Slack Notification** to your team and a **Send Welcome Email** to the client.

## How To Customize Nodes

- **Change Market Focus**: In the **Fetch Market Data** node, change the `symbol` parameter to any ticker your firm specializes in (e.g., `SPY` for S&P 500).

- **Modify AI Strategy**: Edit the prompt in the **Analyze Investor Profile** node to include your specific house views or investment products.

- **Slack Channel**: Re-select your preferred channel in the **Slack Notification** node to ensure alerts go to the right team.

## Use Case Examples

- **Automated Lead Magnets**: Offering a “Free AI Portfolio Review” on your website that delivers results instantly via email.

- **Client Re-Profiling**: Periodically running the workflow for existing clients to see how their strategy should shift based on new market conditions.

- **Scalable Onboarding**: Managing hundreds of new sign-ups during market volatility without increasing headcount.

- **Advisor Assistance**: Using the AI-generated summary as a “cheat sheet” for advisors before they hop on a first call with a lead.

- **Real-time Risk Alerts**: Notifying the team via Slack specifically when a “High Risk” investor joins during “High Volatility” market periods.

## Troubleshooting Guide

| Issue | Possible Cause | Solution |
| :----- | :------------- | :------- |
| **Market Data fails** | Invalid or missing API Key | Ensure your Alpha Vantage key is entered in the **Fetch Market Data** query parameters. |
| **AI output is "unstructured"** | AI failed to follow JSON format | Ensure the **Profile Data Parser** has “Auto Fix” enabled to catch minor formatting errors. |
| **CRM not updating** | Header mismatch | Verify that your Google Sheet has the exact headers: *Timestamp, Name, Age, Income, Profile Summary, Risk Category, Strategy, Email*. |
| **Emails not sending** | Gmail OAuth issues | Re-authenticate your Gmail account in the n8n credentials settings. |
